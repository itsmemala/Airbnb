The bath towels were thick and soft and the shower was great. There are plenty of lovely spaces to hang out in. I wanted to stay longer! We stayed for three nights at this stunning place as part of our honeymoon. Everything you could need and more - fully equipped kitchen, internet (haha), plenty of spaces to relax, beautiful landscape and garden, not far from Sheffield but still quiet and private, and the most warm and wonderful hosts.\n",

      "Thank you Melissa and Peter, your place has a special place in our hearts. This is a gorgeous cottage with views over a pretty landscape from all its rooms - the lounge room with the cupola was very cosy on a rainy night with its gas fire. The kitchen is very well set up and the beds comfortable. We only stayed one night, which we regret as even though away a bit from any town, the cottage would make a great base for travellers exploring the north central / west region.  Very nice and comfortable place. An absolutely wonderful, well appointed and beautiful home to stay in, with lovely hosts. Kentibury Country House is in a very tranquil setting with a very congenial host greeting you upon arrival to give you an introduction to her wonderful accommodation. I highly recommend this accommodation. This is a gorgeous house in absolutely beautiful surroundings. Melissa is a great host and couldn't have been more helpful and welcoming. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and only wish we could have stayed longer. We arrived a little early, nevertheless our hostess appeared to welcome us and give us the grand tour of this beautiful Manor.\n",
      "\n",
      "We unfortunately only had two nights, everything was delightful. We will be back. Melissa’s home is one of the most beautiful we have ever stayed. The location, the house and the lovely little touches were all so welcoming and made our stay incredibly special. If you are looking for a beautiful, serene and secluded getaway, then this is the spot for you. The hosts have built and curated a little slice of Europe for everyone to enjoy, with immaculately presented rooms, gorgeous furniture and a peaceful country setting. Their hospitality was faultless and we loved every minute. Lovely stay, gorgeous hosts- can't recommend highly enough! Hands down the best Airbnb experience my husband and I have ever had. Right from the warm welcome, to checking on us from time to time, giving us tips about what to do and where to go, to even baking us the most delicious chocolate cake for our first wedding anniversary, Melissa is by far the most delightful Airbnb host out there. The house is very well appointed and tastefully furnished with a lot of attention to detail. It's like a slice of Tuscany in the heart of Tasmania. The pictures don't do it justice, you really need to see it in person. It was the perfect spot to explore Cradle mountain, the chocolate factory, the honey farm, Mole's Creek caves and the cheese factory. We will definitely return and highly recommend staying here! We had an excellent stay at Melissa's country house. Very clean, comfortable, warm and well equipped. Easy access by car to many beautiful walks, especially in Cradle Mountain National Park.

The bath towels were thick and soft and the shower was great. There are plenty of lovely spaces to hang out in. I wanted to stay longer! We stayed for three nights at this stunning place as part of our honeymoon. Everything you could need and more - fully equipped kitchen, internet (haha), plenty of spaces to relax, beautiful landscape and garden, not far from Sheffield but still quiet and private, and the most warm and wonderful hosts.\n",

      "Thank you Melissa and Peter, your place has a special place in our hearts. This is a gorgeous cottage with views over a pretty landscape from all its rooms - the lounge room with the cupola was very cosy on a rainy night with its gas fire. The kitchen is very well set up and the beds comfortable. We only stayed one night, which we regret as even though away a bit from any town, the cottage would make a great base for travellers exploring the north central / west region.  Very nice and comfortable place. An absolutely wonderful, well appointed and beautiful home to stay in, with lovely hosts. Kentibury Country House is in a very tranquil setting with a very congenial host greeting you upon arrival to give you an introduction to her wonderful accommodation. I highly recommend this accommodation. This is a gorgeous house in absolutely beautiful surroundings. Melissa is a great host and couldn't have been more helpful and welcoming. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and only wish we could have stayed longer. We arrived a little early, nevertheless our hostess appeared to welcome us and give us the grand tour of this beautiful Manor.\n",

      "We unfortunately only had two nights, everything was delightful. We will be back. Melissa’s home is one of the most beautiful we have ever stayed. The location, the house and the lovely little touches were all so welcoming and made our stay incredibly special. If you are looking for a beautiful, serene and secluded getaway, then this is the spot for you. The hosts have built and curated a little slice of Europe for everyone to enjoy, with immaculately presented rooms, gorgeous furniture and a peaceful country setting. Their hospitality was faultless and we loved every minute. Lovely stay, gorgeous hosts- can't recommend highly enough! Hands down the best Airbnb experience my husband and I have ever had. Right from the warm welcome, to checking on us from time to time, giving us tips about what to do and where to go, to even baking us the most delicious chocolate cake for our first wedding anniversary, Melissa is by far the most delightful Airbnb host out there. The house is very well appointed and tastefully furnished with a lot of attention to detail. It's like a slice of Tuscany in the heart of Tasmania. The pictures don't do it justice, you really need to see it in person. It was the perfect spot to explore Cradle mountain, the chocolate factory, the honey farm, Mole's Creek caves and the cheese factory. We will definitely return and highly recommend staying here! We had an excellent stay at Melissa's country house. Very clean, comfortable, warm and well equipped. Easy access by car to many beautiful walks, especially in Cradle Mountain National Park. Melissa was also very welcoming and easy to communicate with. Highly recommend.\n",

      "Home has amazing view and is very quiet. Melissa's country house is gorgeous. The beds are amazingly comfortable and each room has a stunning view.  The bath towels were thick and soft and the shower was great. There are plenty of lovely spaces to hang out in. I wanted to stay longer! We stayed for three nights at this stunning place as part of our honeymoon. Everything you could need and more - fully equipped kitchen, internet (haha), plenty of spaces to relax, beautiful landscape and garden, not far from Sheffield but still quiet and private, and the most warm and wonderful hosts.\n",

      "Thank you Melissa and Peter, your place has a special place in our hearts. This is a gorgeous cottage with views over a pretty landscape from all its rooms - the lounge room with the cupola was very cosy on a rainy night with its gas fire. The kitchen is very well set up and the beds comfortable. We only stayed one night, which we regret as even though away a bit from any town, the cottage would make a great base for travellers exploring the north central / west region.  Very nice and comfortable place. An absolutely wonderful, well appointed and beautiful home to stay in, with lovely hosts. Kentibury Country House is in a very tranquil setting with a very congenial host greeting you upon arrival to give you an introduction to her wonderful accommodation. I highly recommend this accommodation. This is a gorgeous house in absolutely beautiful surroundings. Melissa is a great host and couldn't have been more helpful and welcoming. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and only wish we could have stayed longer. We arrived a little early, nevertheless our hostess appeared to welcome us and give us the grand tour of this beautiful Manor.\n",

      "We unfortunately only had two nights, everything was delightful. We will be back. Melissa’s home is one of the most beautiful we have ever stayed. The location, the house and the lovely little touches were all so welcoming and made our stay incredibly special. If you are looking for a beautiful, serene and secluded getaway, then this is the spot for you. The hosts have built and curated a little slice of Europe for everyone to enjoy, with immaculately presented rooms, gorgeous furniture and a peaceful country setting. Their hospitality was faultless and we loved every minute. Lovely stay, gorgeous hosts- can't recommend highly enough! Hands down the best Airbnb experience my husband and I have ever had. Right from the warm welcome, to checking on us from time to time, giving us tips about what to do and where to go, to even baking us the most delicious chocolate cake for our first wedding anniversary, Melissa is by far the most delightful Airbnb host out there. The house is very well appointed and tastefully furnished with a lot of attention to detail. It's like a slice of Tuscany in the heart of Tasmania. The pictures don't do it justice, you really need to see it in person. It was the perfect spot to explore Cradle mountain, the chocolate factory, the honey farm, Mole's Creek caves and the cheese factory. We will definitely return and highly recommend staying here! We had an excellent stay at Melissa's country house. Very clean, comfortable, warm and well equipped. Easy access by car to many beautiful walks, especially in Cradle Mountain National Park. Melissa was also very welcoming and easy to communicate with. Highly recommend.\n",
